### Hi there 👋


**Jimmy-INL/Jimmy-INL** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently a Modeling and simulation specialist, a machine learning staff scientist at Idaho National Laboratory, and a member of RAVEN development team, working on several projects including -but not limited to- Surrogate Construction, Reduced Order Modeling, sparse sensing, metamodeling of porous materials, scaling interpolation and representativity of mockup experiments to target real-world plants, data-driven discovery of governing physics and system identification, digital twins, Time series analysis, Koopman theory, agile software development, and more.   
- 🌱 I’d love to learn in the near future: MLOps, R, Cafee, mongoDB, MySQL,NoSQL, SCALA, Julia, SAS, SPSS, ApacheSpark, Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, MapReduce, Casandra, Weka.   
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Physics-based neural networks.
